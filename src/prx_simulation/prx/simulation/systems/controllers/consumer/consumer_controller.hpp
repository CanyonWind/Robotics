         * is responsible for either receiving (passive) or actively querying (active)
         * plans from the planning node.
         * 
         * Consumer controllers are tied to a single planning node. However, planning nodes
         * are capable of operating over one or many consumer controllers.
         * 
         * For active consumers, the controller operates over one or many goals. The consumer
         * will query for a single goal and then consume the plan to reach that goal, before
         * querying for the next goal.
         * 
         * For passive consumers, the controller waits until it has received a plan from the
         * planning node, after which it will begin to consume controls from the plan. 
         * 
         * Once the plan has been consumed, the controller will enter its contingency
         * plan. Depending on whether or not \c keep_last_control has been set to true,
         * the consumer will either use the most recently consumed control or revert to
         * a default behavior (such as stop moving).
